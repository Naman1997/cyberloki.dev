Hi! Welcome to my portfolio website!

<p>I am a software engineer with a passion for open source. I have been contributing to open source projects since 2018, and I am always looking for new ways to contribute. I am proficient in languages such as <span id="k">Java</span>, <span id="k">Golang</span> and <span id="k">Python</span>.</p>

I also like to play with infrastructure as code in my free time and have worked with tools such as <span id="k">Terraform</span>, <span id="k">Packer</span> and <span id="k">Proxmox</span>.

<p> Some of the projects that I've worked on are: </p>
<br> <a href="https://github.com/Naman1997/simple-fcos-cluster">simple-fcos-cluster</a>
<p> A simple kubernetes cluster using Fedora Core OS, Proxmox and k0sctl. This repo also includes instructions on how to expose the cluster to the internet securely over WireGuard.</p>

<br> <a href="https://github.com/Naman1997/arch-cloud-image">arch-cloud-image</a>
<p> Packer template that creates a modified cloud image using the official Arch Linux cloud image. Also creates a new user in the image that uses my zsh config.</p>

<br> <a href="https://github.com/Naman1997/VAAK">go-strategize</a>
<p> A simple CLI program that provisions your infrastructure using terraform and configures it using ansible.</p>

<p>Cheers!</p>
